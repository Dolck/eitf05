# eitf05 - Webshop under attack

## Funcionality
* ~~New users signing up. When signing up, users choose a username, password and enter a home
address.~~
* ~~Existing users signing in. The username must be clearly shown on the page when a user is logged
in.~~
* ~~Adding items to shopping cart.~~
* ~~Checkout and payment. The payment should just be simulated, but once finished the user should
be presented with a receipt with all details of the purchase. That is, it should look real, although
the payment functionality itself is just simulated.~~

## Security
* ~~Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)~~
* ~~Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)~~
* ~~SQL Injection~~
* ~~Remote File Inclusion (optional)~~
