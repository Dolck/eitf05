# eitf05 - Webshop under attack

* ~~New users signing up. When signing up, users choose a username, password and enter a home
address.~~
* ~~Existing users signing in. The username must be clearly shown on the page when a user is logged
in.~~
* ~~Adding items to shopping cart.~~
* Checkout and payment. The payment should just be simulated, but once finished the user should
be presented with a receipt with all details of the purchase. That is, it should look real, although
the payment functionality itself is just simulated.


# Usage
